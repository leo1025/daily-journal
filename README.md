# daily-journal
Author: Leona DA

This is a simple Daily Journal Website app. Using EJS, MongoDB, Bootstrap and NodeJS. Deployed live to the Web using Heroku Hosting.

This was built following a Udemy Tutorial by Angela Yu. This app is meant as a stepping stone towards learning Web Development. Along as a first Attempt at creating a Blog-style Website that will eventually lead up to creating my own personal blog and website. The first half of the project was purely following tutorials while second half was customizing the project to my specifications.

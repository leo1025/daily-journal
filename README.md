# daily-journal
Author: Leona DA

This is a simple Daily Journal Website app. Using EJS, MongoDB, Bootstrap and NodeJS. Deployed live to the Web using Heroku Hosting.

This was built following a Udemy Tutorial by Angela Yu. This app is meant as a stepping stone towards learning Web Development. Along as a first Attempt at creating a Blog-style Website that will eventually lead up to creating my own personal blog and website.

## To run from source
Clone repo, ensure Nodemon is installed

`npm install`

`nodemon app.js`

## Live site
Unfortunately, due to Heroku moving towards a permanently paid model. This site will not be live hosted. However, moving forward, new projects will deployed using a different hosting service.
